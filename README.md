            The hate crimes dataset (2017â€“2025) shows a rising trend in reported incidents, with 2024 having the highest number of cases. Most hate crimes occurred in November, and the majority involved adult victims and adult offenders, with very few incidents involving minors. The most common offenses were Criminal Mischief and Assault, often driven by biases such as Anti-Black, Anti-Gay (Male), and Anti-Jewish sentiments. Correlation analysis indicated that offenders and victims are usually from the same age group. Overall, hate crimes in this dataset are predominantly adult-driven, recurring annually, and often fueled by racial or sexual orientation bias.
